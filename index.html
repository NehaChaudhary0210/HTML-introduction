    <p>The new Apple MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini with the Apple M1 SoC have kickstarted the company's multi-year
        transition from Intel CPUs to its own in-house silicon. Apple's previous pivotal computing shift came about 15 years 
        ago when it announced its transition from the PowerPC architecture to Intel CPUs,and now it's doing it again. 
        This move was a long time coming, and a necessary one since it allows Apple greater control over the design and performance of its Mac computers. 
        More importantly, it should also allow Apple to better plan future product roadmaps, now that it knows exactly what kind of chips to expect going ahead.</p>
